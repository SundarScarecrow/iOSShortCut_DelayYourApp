## Delay your Social Media addiction by 10 seconds

How to use it?
1. Install the shortcut on your phone.
2. You can customize the wait time in the settings. 
3. And when you open, a delay of 10 seconds is kicked off. Then you will receive a prompt asking do you want to open the app. Which you would have to type 'Yes' which opens your app and simultaneously starts a timer to remind you to close the app. 
4. This shortcut can be edited for any app that you deem to be a time killer. The reminder timer is also customizable.
5. Click on the settings and select the option, add to home screen.
6. Finally to finish it off, just download a logo image of the app and then change the icon to trick your mind into believing it is the real app.
